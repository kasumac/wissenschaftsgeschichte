In order to unite Newtonian gravity with special relativity, both natural
constants $$G$$ and $$c^{-1}$$ must be taken into account. This is exactly what
Einstein's General Theory of Relativity (1915) does. It transforms the static
four-dimensional Minkowskian space-time into a dynamic and curved object, whose
shape is uniquely fixed by Einstein's field equations. In curved space-time,
objects always move on the shortest possible path as determined by an
indefinite metric. A historically important example is Mercury's orbit around
the Sun.

According to Einstein, the Sun curves space-time in a way that results in a
nearly elliptic orbit, up to a small perihelion shift. Contrary to Newton, the
reason for Mercury's curved path is not some mysterious gravitational force
emanating from the Sun, but simple economy. An analogy is the trajectory of an
airplane from Berlin to New York: it is curved, but by no means due to a
hypothetical force at the North Pole.

Why was Albert Einstein so sure that he had to develop a new theory of gravity?
In fact, Max Planck was not aware of the cube's missing fourth classical
corner, corresponding to $$c^{-1}$$ and $$G$$. Accordingly, Planck \emph{strongly
recommended} him to not waste his time, but to rather focus on the development
of quantum mechanics. However, Einstein was acutely aware that Newtonian
gravitational theory and special relativity are fundamentally incompatible. For
example, in the former, a change in the distance between two masses results in
an instantaneously felt change in the gravitational force acting between them.
In contradistinction, in special relativity signal transmission at velocities
greater than c is impossible. This fundamental feature, that Newtonian gravity
depends merely on location but not on time, had to be eliminated by general
relativity.

In hindsight, the most elegant way to derive the latter theory involves a
suitable action principle. Let us first recall the much simpler derivation of
Newton's laws based on such a principle. One considers a body's movement over a
period of time and to determine and determines the actual path traveled
according to a suitable criterion. »The path of actual reproduction is that to
which the smallest amount of action belongs!« (Maupertuis 1744) This extreme
value principle then implies the famous Euler-Lagrange equations:

$$
\frac{d}{dt}\frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{q}_i}-\frac{\partial L}{\partial q_i}=0
$$

Here, $$q_{i}(t)$$ is the coordinate of the i-th particle at time $$t$$, and
$$L$$ the Lagrangian, given by the difference between the particles' kinetic
and potential energies. These precisely reproduce Newton's equations of motion.
Incidentally, note that this derivation is based on an erroneous fundamental
asymmetry of space and time: the different states of a particle are integrated
over time.

Generalising this idea to Einsteinian gravity, one is looking for a suitable
action $$S$$ that allows for its minimisation under arbitrary variations of the
metric:

$$
\frac{\delta S}{\delta g_{\mu\nu}}=0
$$

The latter is then once again calculated by using an analogue of the
Euler-Lagrange equations. The correct choice is now called the Einstein-Hilbert
action and leads to Einstein's field equations:

$$
R_{\mu\nu}-\frac{1}{2}g_{\mu\nu}R=\frac{8\pi G}{c^4}T_{\mu\nu}
$$

They describe in a mathematically rigorous fashion that matter ($$T_{μν}$$) bends
($$R_{μν}$$ and $$R$$) space-time ($$g_{μν})$$. Particles move in this metric on
curved tracks without experiencing any force: gravity simply corresponds to the
curvature of space-time.

»Therefore, in the following we want to assume the complete physical equivalence
of gravitational field and corresponding acceleration of the reference
system.«<d-cite key="einstein:1907"></d-cite>

The objects that move in the cosmos thus follow only one goal in their orbits:
the shortest and fastest connection in a curved space-time. On their way they
bend with their mass and energy the space-time in their immediate vicinity.
Everything is in motion, everything influences this dynamic and highly
non-linear manifold. General relativity solves the contradictions between
Newton's theory of gravity and special relativity by making both constants
$$G$$ and $$c^{-1}$$ relevant at the same time: as the theory ($$G$$,
$$c^{-1}$$, 0) of the cube.

In 1916, Einstein also predicted in his General Theory of Relativity that
gravitational waves must exist in analogy to electromagnetic waves. But their
experimental proof seemed unrealistic to him. In 2016, this proof was achieved
for the first time with the Laser Interferometer Gravitational Wave Observatory
(LIGO). The origin of gravitational waves could be explained by the collapse of
a binary system of black holes.
